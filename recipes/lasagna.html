      Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded <br />
      pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with <br />
      Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce <br />
      (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce).

        An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons
        of flavor
      </li>
      <br />

        <b>Sugar:</b>
        Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the
        flavor of the sauce
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Spices and seasonings:</b>

      <li>
        <b>Cheeses:</b>
        Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra
